## Course Description

This course is intended to be a survey on the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie current and emerging methods, tools, and techniques for the design and implementation of modern programming languages. This includes the understanding and appreciation of topics in designing and implementing modern programming languages such as attribute grammars, operational, axiomatic, and denotational semantics, and (static and dynamic) type systems.

## Topics

Please note that this schedule is tentative:

- Attribute grammars 
- Operational semantics for Lisp
- Operational semantics for an imperative language	
- Axiomatic semantics
- Type systems
- Programming language concepts for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) systems.

## Suggested Previous Courses

- CSc 70010: Algorithms
- Computer Theory or equivalent.

## Homework

The course will include several written assignments and one large programming project, possibly submitted in pieces. Each will be assigned in Blackboard along with submission instructions. Assignments will be uploaded to Blackboard and the programming project will be uploaded to GitHub classroom and submitted via gradescope. The exact instructions will follow. The project must include command-line instructions on how to run the program.

### Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments, if applicable.
- Assignments must result from **individual** effort unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

## Exams

Test make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
- the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected for class meetings. Student are responsible for obtaining and covering any material missed due to absence.

## Academic Violations

The classroom environment employed will be that of a professional one. While students may discuss course materials and assignments with others, any submitted work in this course must be the result of *individual* effort *only*. Students are *strongly* advised to read the following resources regarding academic integrity:

- [Student Handbook](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/student-handbook)
- [Avoiding and Detecting Plagiarism](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/AvoidingPlagiarism.pdf)
